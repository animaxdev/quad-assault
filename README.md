# quad-assault
I wrote this when I was a kid. Please, for the love of god, don't use this as a learning resource - I only put it here because I'm proud I managed to write this in high-school. Requires toolset for Visual Studio 2010 because I couldn't find the source of the SFML version I made it with to recompile the binaries.
